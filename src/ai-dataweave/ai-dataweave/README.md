# AI-Generated DataWeave Examples

This folder demonstrates how LLM-generated DataWeave mappings can be
reviewed, constrained, and validated before being used in production
MuleSoft integrations.

These examples are intentionally simple and focus on:
• Guardrails for AI-generated transformations
• Default handling
• Type safety
• Production readiness
