mulesoft-ai-utils

AI-powered utilities, DataWeave functions, and integration patterns for modern MuleSoft engineers

⸻

🚀 Overview

mulesoft-ai-utils is an open-source toolkit that brings AI-assisted development, reusable DataWeave functions, and event-driven integration patterns into the MuleSoft ecosystem.

As enterprises move toward API-led, event-driven, and AI-enhanced architectures, MuleSoft developers need faster, smarter, and standardized tools.
This project provides ready-to-use utilities for:
	•	🔹 DataWeave transformations
	•	🔹 LLM-assisted mapping helpers
	•	🔹 Kafka integration samples
	•	🔹 AI log summarization
	•	🔹 Automation templates
	•	🔹 API-led reusable components

This toolkit is designed to accelerate development and improve architecture quality across modern enterprise systems.

🧠 Why This Project Exists

Modern integration teams struggle with:

❌ Repetitive transformation logic
❌ Slow mapping development
❌ Lack of AI utilization in integrations
❌ Complex Kafka + MuleSoft patterns
❌ Reinventing API-led components
❌ Poor reusability across teams

This project solves those problems by providing:

✔ standardized utilities
✔ AI-driven productivity boosters
✔ ready-made integration patterns
✔ enterprise-grade templates
✔ structured architecture best practices

🧪 Example (Simple DataWeave Helper)

%dw 2.0
fun toCanonicalFormat(payload) =
{
    id: payload.Id default "",
    name: payload.FullName default "",
    email: payload.Email default ""
}

More examples coming soon!

🧠 AI-Assisted Mapping Example (Planned)

POST /ai/mapping-suggestion

Input:
{
  "sourcePayload": {...},
  "targetSchema": {...}
}

Output:
{
  "suggestedDataWeaveScript": "..."
}
